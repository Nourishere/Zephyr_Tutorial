# A Zephyr Tutorial
* This repository aims to provide a thorough tutorial on the Zephyr real time operating system (RTOS).
* It is intended for people who are learning about Zephyr, building a project based on Zephyr, or joining Zephyr's developement.
* The repository contains arranged documents in the Markdown format

# Structure
* The repository structure is as follows:
```
examples/
notes/
```
* Under `notes/` you can find arranged tutorial documents with the Markdown format.
* Under `examples/` you can find various Zephyr demo projects.

## What is the Zephyr Project?
* The Zephyr™ Project, is a Linux Foundation hosted Collaboration Project, an open source collaborative effort uniting leaders from across the industry to build a best-in-breed small, scalable, real-time operating system (RTOS) optimized for resource constrained devices, across multiple architectures. The Zephyr Project’s goal is to establish a neutral project where silicon vendors, OEMs, ODMs, ISVs, and OSVs can contribute technology to reduce the cost and accelerate time to market for developing the billions of devices that will make up the majority of the Internet of Things.

- [OpenOCD](./notes/OpenOCD.md)

#### Running Freestanding Applications (outside the zephyr directory)
To make things easier, `cd` into the zephyr repo in your local machine and run the following commands:
```bash
west build /path/to/app -d /path/to/app/build -b <board_name> -p always
west flash /path/to/app/build
```
- This works because the environment variables required to build a zephyr application already exist inside the zephyr project, you can add these variables to your `.bashrc` but it didn't work for me.
- The other way is to create your application as a west workspace, check notes on west workspaces for more details.

If you are working with qemu, run using the following command:
```bash
west build /path/to/app -d /path/to/app/build -b <board_name> -p always
west build /path/to/app/build -t run
```
- You don't have to pass in the build directory when running if you are inside the application where the build lives.
